            <p>
              Featuring material from their 2017 collaboration with Korean quartet Black String, plus a swathe of brand
              new original compositions, A Gathering encapsulates a milestone in their sound. Recorded at Roundhead
              Studios in Auckland, it is a beautifully produced illustration of a band at the height of its powers;
              showcasing their intricate and immersive compositions; tight ensemble playing, and assertive, individual
              improvising voices. Two of the tracks from the album, “Beyond the Palace” and “A Gathering” were nominated
              for the APRA NZ Best Jazz Composition of the Year Award in 2018, and a third, “Tui”, won the same award in
              2020.

              Given the emergence of Covid-19 in March 2020, The Jac’s accompanying tour was put on the back-burner
              until 2021. A Gathering will now be released in two stages: This is the first five of 10 tracks and the
              second five will be released in the lead up to the 2021 tour.

            <p>
              Since 2010 the 8-piece ensemble The Jac has been a leading voice in the New Zealand jazz scene, pushing a
              modern sound with their distinctive, through-composed compositions, tight ensemble playing and impressive
              live shows. Based in Wellington and drawing talent from Melbourne and Montreal, the band brings together
              musicians from the jazz, classical and metal scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Jac have gone from strength to strength: their debut album Nerve (2014) was nominated for the NZ Music
              Awards Best Jazz Album of the year; the opening track “Sons of Thunder” from The Green Hour (2015) won New
              Zealand’s inaugural Jazz Composition of the Year award; in 2017 they performed 12 shows around the country
              as part of Chamber Music New Zealand’s “Encompass” tour, solidifying their cross-genre credentials; and
              this was followed by a headlining concert with Korean traditional/jazz fusion group, Black String, at the
              Wellington Jazz Festival, which sold out and garnered rave reviews. A spot at the Jarasum International
              Jazz Festival and a tour of 6 cities in South Korea followed. In 2019 they were again awarded Jazz
              Composition of the Year award for “Chungin’”
            </p>
            <p>
              The band features musicians bringing influences and expertise from outside the jazz spectrum. Notable
              among these are Matthew Allison, associate principal trombonist in the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and
              Shaun Anderson, drummer for metal bands Saving Grace and Depths. Completing the line-up are Alexis French,
              trumpet; Nick Tipping, bass; Chris Buckland, saxophones; Daniel Millward, piano and compositions; Callum
              Allardice, guitar and compositions; and Jake Baxendale, saxophones and compositions.
